    <h3>Gold</h3>

    <p>Gold is one of the most ancient and universally recognized precious metals. Its allure stems from its rarity, malleability, and resistance to tarnish. Here's a closer look at gold. Gold is a soft, dense metal with the chemical symbol Au. It is chemically inert, meaning it doesn’t corrode, rust, or tarnish over time, making it ideal for creating lasting jewelry and coins. It is one of the least reactive metals, which contributes to its enduring beauty.</p>

    <p>Emerald is a variety of the mineral beryl, colored by trace amounts of chromium or vanadium. Its vibrant green hue has made it one of the most coveted gemstones in the world. Emeralds are primarily composed of beryl (Be₃Al₂Si₆O₁₈) with chromium or vanadium giving them their characteristic green color. Emeralds are relatively hard (8 on the Mohs scale of hardness), but they can be brittle and are often treated with oils or resins to enhance their clarity.</p>

    <p>Diamonds are among the hardest naturally occurring substances on Earth and have long been symbols of eternal love and wealth. Diamonds are composed of pure carbon atoms arranged in a crystal lattice structure, making them the hardest known natural material (10 on the Mohs scale). This gives diamonds their unrivaled brilliance and durability. They are transparent and come in a range of colors, though the most prized are colorless or near-colorless diamonds.</p>
